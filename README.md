Alpha Sigma Phi website update

This was a project that I set out to do in order to give a much needed update to website for my
chapter of the Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity. I decided to go with a template from -WpF Degree- because
I thought it was very well designed and wanted to save myself a bit of time on the front-end.

This Project is currently being developed slowly but surely in my free time.
